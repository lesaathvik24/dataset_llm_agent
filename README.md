<u>
**Dataset Creation AI Agent**
</u>
<br />
This repository contains a Dockerized AI Agent designed to facilitate the creation of large datasets for LLM (Large Language Model) fine-tuning. The agent leverages the capabilities of Claude-3-5-Sonnet-20240620, a powerful language model from Anthropic, to automate the otherwise complex and labor-intensive task of dataset creation.
<br />
<strong>Features:</strong>
<br />
Automated Dataset Generation: The AI agent can generate extensive datasets, reducing the manual effort required in curating data for LLM fine-tuning.
<br />
Customizable Prompts: The agent uses prompts to guide dataset creation, which can be customized to suit various needs and domains.
<br />
Dockerized for Ease of Use: The agent is encapsulated in a Docker container, ensuring consistent performance across different environments and simplifying the setup process.
<br />
<strong>Model Used:</strong>
<br />
The AI agent uses the claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 model from Anthropic. This model is designed to handle a wide range of language tasks and is particularly effective for generating high-quality datasets for LLM fine-tuning.
